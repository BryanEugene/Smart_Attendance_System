## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a face recognition system using Python and React. The backend performs detection and recognition of human faces using machine learning models, while the frontend UI (built with React) provides an interactive interface. The system includes processes such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and real-time face recognition.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Identify and locate faces in an image.
- **Face Recognition**: Match faces to a predefined set of known identities.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes image resizing, scaling, and normalization.
- **Model Training**: Train a face recognition model with a labeled dataset.
- **User Interface**: Interactive UI built with React to facilitate data input and visualization.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FaceRecognition.git
   ```
2. Install the required backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the React frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook for backend processing:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook FaceRecognition(2).ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- **Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook to view, edit, and execute each code cell interactively.
- **React Frontend**: Open the frontend in your browser to interact with the face recognition system.
- **Face Recognition Execution**: Follow the instructions within the notebook and the frontend UI to preprocess data, train the model, and test it with sample images.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Backend, Face Recognition)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **React** (Frontend, UI)
- **JavaScript**
- **Machine Learning Libraries**:
  - **OpenCV**: For image processing and face detection.
  - **TensorFlow/Keras**: For training and deploying the face recognition model.
  - **scikit-learn**: For model evaluation and metrics.

## Future Enhancements

- Improve model accuracy with additional data.
- Explore additional face recognition techniques or architectures.
- Further develop the React UI for a more user-friendly experience.
- Integrate backend and frontend for seamless real-time face recognition.
