## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a face recognition system using [insert specific libraries used] to perform detection and recognition of human faces. It involves key processes such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, designed to match input images against a database of known faces.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Identify and locate faces in an image.
- **Face Recognition**: Match faces to a predefined set of known identities.
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes image resizing, scaling, and normalization.
- **Model Training**: Train a face recognition model with a labeled dataset.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FaceRecognition.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook FaceRecognition(2).ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- **Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook to view, edit, and execute each code cell interactively.
- **Face Recognition Execution**: Follow the instructions within each cell to preprocess the data, train the model, and test it with sample images.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- [Include specific libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, etc.]

## Future Enhancements

- Improve model accuracy with additional data.
- Explore additional face recognition techniques or architectures.
- Develop a user-friendly interface.
